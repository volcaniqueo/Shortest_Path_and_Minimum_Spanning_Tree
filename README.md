# Shortest_Path_and_Minimum_Spanning_Tree
This project was my 3rd Homework for the course CMPE 250 (Data Structures and Algorithms) at Bogazici University.
## About the Project
This project was about 'Shortest Path' and 'Minimum Spanning Tree' problems. I implemented Djiktra's Algorithm for shortest path and Prim's Algorithm for minimum spanning tree. I mainly used HashMap in order to have constant (theta (1)) complexity for accessing the data. This approach made my project efficient; but with the usage of just two dimensional arrays, I could have had the best efficiency. Detailed story about the project and the input/output formats can be found in the description.

Important Note: In very large input cases, as well as some small ones, there may be several different shortest paths; thus the answer would depend on the some implementation choices of the Djiktra's algorithm. (There would be several correct answers.)
## To Run the Code
First compile using:
```javac CMPE250_HW3_volcaniqueo/src/*.java -d CMPE250_HW3_volcaniqueo/bin```

Then move onto bin:
```cd CMPE250_HW3_volcaniqueo/bin```

Finally run using arguments:
```java project3main <input_file> <output_file>```
